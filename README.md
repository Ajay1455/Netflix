<h3>Here is the basic code structure</h3>

    Set up the backend:
        Create an Express.js server to handle API requests.
        Implement MongoDB or a similar database to store user information, movies, and other data.
        Use JWT for user authentication and authorization.
        Set up routes for user registration, login, and accessing movies or TV shows.

    Build the frontend:
        Use React.js for creating the user interface.
        Set up routing to navigate between different pages, such as the registration page, login page, and home page.
        Create reusable components for forms, buttons, and other UI elements.
        Use React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage component state and make API requests to the backend.

    Implement user registration and login functionality:
        Create registration and login forms to collect user input.
        Send API requests to the backend to handle user registration and login.
        Store the JWT token securely in the frontend (e.g., using local storage or cookies) for subsequent authenticated requests.

    Develop the home page:
        Fetch movie or TV show data from the backend API.
        Display the retrieved data in an organized and visually appealing way.
        Implement features like search, filters, and pagination to enhance user experience.

    Style the application:
        Use CSS or a CSS preprocessor (e.g., Sass) to style the components.
        Consider using a UI library or framework (e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap) for faster development and consistent styling.
